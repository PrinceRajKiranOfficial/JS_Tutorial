Timing Events
• JavaScript can be executed in time-intervals. This is called timing
events.
• The window object allows execution of code at specified time
intervals.
• The two key methods to use with JavaScript are:
        →setTimeout(function, milliseconds)
                    Executes a function, after waiting a specified number of milliseconds.
        →setinterval(function, milliseconds)
                    Same as setTimeout, but repeats the execution of the function continuously.
