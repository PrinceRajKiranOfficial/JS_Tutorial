Loops
â€¢ Loops are used to do a repeated task until a specified
condition remains true.
â€¢ Different types of loops are
    ðŸš— For loop -> you know the ending of loops (Note:- for printing the arrays( For each,For of,For in))
            It is best to use for loop when we know that the code should be executed specified number of times.
            Syntax:
                for (initialization; condition; increment) {
                //code block to be executed}
                    ðŸ¦´ initialization - used to initialize the variable, which is being used for iteration. It is executed once before the code block gets executed.
                    ðŸ¦´condition - defines condition which determine till when iteration will continue. i.e., how many times you want to execute the statements within this block.
                    ðŸ¦´ increment - executed every time after the code block has been 
            ðŸ”¥ For each -








            ðŸ”¥ For of - you will get all the elements of the arrays
                    let cars=['Volvo','Toyota','Audi','BMW']
                    for (i of cars)
                    {
                        console.log(i)
                    }

            ðŸ”¥ For in -> using for in loop you will get the ouput in indexes.
                // it will give all the index 
                        let fruits=['apple','orange','mango']
                        for (a in fruits)
                        {
                            console.log(a)
                        }

    ðŸš— While loop
        Note:- You do not know the end of loop
                let k=0;
        while (k<5){
            console.log(k)
            k++;
        } 



    ðŸš—Do-while loop
        Note:- First Implementing then checking the condition

        //synchornize - sequal execution
        //asynchornize - parallel execution

            //do while
                    let j = 1
                    do {
                        console.log(j)//1
                        j++
                    } while (j >= 4)







Break
    â€¢ The break statement "jumps out" of a loop.
        Example:
            for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            if (i == 3) { break; }
            text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
            }
            Output:
            The number is 0
            The number is 1
            The number is 2
            Note:
            the break statement ends the loop, when the loop counter, i is 3.

                // break
                for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                    if (i == 3) {break;}
                    console.log("The number is " + i)
                }


Continue
        to skip the iteration
            for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                if (i === 6) {continue;} //except 6 each no will be printed
                console.log("The number is " + i)
            }
